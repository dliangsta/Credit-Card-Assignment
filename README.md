This project uses a decision tree to determine an assigment of a credit card to as specific individual.

My pruning algorithm tries a number of different things to improve the accuracy of the decision tree in classifying the given tuning set. It conducts a DFS traversal of the decision tree and switches the current node it is considering during the search to a terminal node and see's if the accuracy improves. If it does, the change stays. Otherwise, it is switched back. The same happens with the BFS traversal. Then I implemented an algorithm that switches all pairs of nodes from non-terminal to terminal. Then I implemented an algorithm that randomly selects nodes to switch to terminal. If the program takes too long for you to run, then take out the for loops in the decision tree implementation constructor with the tune set please.
